# 📚 Task 2: RAG-Based Semantic Quote Retrieval System

## 🔍 Overview
This project implements a **semantic quote retrieval system** using a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) approach. It allows users to search quotes based on natural language queries and optionally get structured answers from a fine-tuned language model.

## ✨ Features
- Embed quotes using `sentence-transformers`
- Store and search embeddings using `FAISS`
- Retrieve top semantic matches for any query
- (Optional) Generate structured answers using LLM
- User-friendly interface built with `Streamlit`

## 🧠 Tech Stack
- Python
- Hugging Face Transformers
- Sentence Transformers
- FAISS
- Streamlit


## ⚙️ Installation

Install all required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
